Usage of multimap:

In the Student Grade Report Management System project, a multimap data structure is used to store and manage student data for each class. Here's how multimap is utilized:

Data Storage:

The multimap is used to store student information such as name, grade, and marks for each class.
Each class has its own multimap instance, allowing the system to manage student data separately for different classes.

Key-Value Pair:

In the multimap, the student name serves as the key, and the Student object (containing grade and marks) serves as the value.
This key-value pair structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of student information based on their names.

Multiple Students with Same Name:

Since student names may not be unique within a class, multimap allows storing multiple key-value pairs with the same key (student name).
This enables the system to handle cases where multiple students have the same name without losing any data.

Ordered Storage:

multimap maintains its elements in a sorted order based on the key (student name) by default.
This ensures that student data is stored in alphabetical order of names, facilitating easy lookup and retrieval of student information.

Efficient Operations:

multimap provides efficient operations for insertion, removal, and retrieval of elements.
This allows the system to quickly add new students, remove existing students, and display student reports without compromising performance.

Flexibility:

multimap offers flexibility in handling student data, allowing for dynamic updates and modifications as needed.
Teachers can easily manage student records and perform necessary operations without constraints imposed by the data structure.
